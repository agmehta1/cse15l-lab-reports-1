# Week 2 Lab Report
## This report includes the steps I took to complete the week 1 lab

1. The first step is to download VsCode if it is not already installed. I will demonstrate the setup for VsCode for Windows.

* Download VsCode using this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

* Once VsCode has been downloaded, open up the program. You should see a window like this

* Click on the extensions tab on the left side of the window. It is the image on the bottom with the foru squares.

* Search "java" in the search bar and install the "Extension Pack for Java" and "Debugger for Java" if they are not already installed. You may also install any other extensions that you would find useful.
